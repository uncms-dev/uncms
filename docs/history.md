# History of UnCMS

UnCMS was originally written by Dave Hall, as [etianen-cms](https://github.com/etianen/cms).
UnCMS still very much resembles Dave Hall's original work.
As such, much of the [philosophy](philosophy.md) of this project, though it was not codified into writing until over a decade later, is at the least inspired by this original incarnation.

Later, this was forked into [Onespacemedia CMS](https://github.com/onespacemedia/cms) by Onespacemedia, a digital agency in Cambridge, England.
During this era, it powered hundreds of websites and suffered very few bugs in its core.
The codebase did, however, suffer from an accretion of cruft and unnecessary features
(which is no slight against any of the authors, as I was responsible for writing some of them).
Yet, at its core, there was always a tiny, elegant not-quite-a-CMS waiting to get out.

Development on onespacemedia-cms halted in 2021, and no updates were made for Django versions after 2.2.
In the years since I left Onespacemedia, I occasionally found myself needing something that looked very much like onespacemedia-cms for small personal projects.
Over a period of some time, I ported it to a modern LTS version of Django, removed a pile of features, and added a few features that are useful for most projects.
I released this work publicly as a Christmas present to the world on December 25, 2022.

The following authors have not worked on UnCMS under its current name,
but the existence of UnCMS certainly owes a debt to every one of them.
