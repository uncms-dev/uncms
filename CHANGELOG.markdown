# Changelog

## 1.0.0

This is the first release of UnCMS, forked from version onespacemedia-cms 4.4.

* Rename! ðŸ¥³ This project is now UnCMS, because it is not quite a CMS. It now has a documented philosophy and a maintainer.
* Django 3.2 is now supported.
* Page localisation support has been removed. Its core idea was fatally flawed; it had an unjustified assumption that a user's _country_ would determine what language they preferred. On top of that, it was undocumented, and it never worked all that well. Not having more than one version of a page is now a core part of the UnCMS philosophy.
* Configuration is now handled in a single `UNCMS` dictionary in your config file. `WYSIWYG_OPTIONS` and `PUBLICATION_MIDDLEWARE_EXCLUDE_URLS` now have sensible defaults. If you have changed any of the defaults you may wish to move them into the `UNCMS` configuration dictionary.
* Paths in `PUBLICATION_MIDDLEWARE_EXCLUDE_URLS` must now begin with a forward slash.
* TinyPNG support has been removed. Image size reduction is better implemented per-project with post-save hooks, if it is needed.
* Django Jet support has been removed, because Django Jet is dead. Not being tied to any particular admin skin, and being made with the stock Django admin as a first-class citizen, is now a core part of the UnCMS philosophy.
* usertools dependency has been removed.
* historylinks is no longer a requirement.
* The `Link.new_window` field has been retired. It encouraged the slow practice of checking for `Page.content.new_window` in the navigation.
* The canonical location of `ImageRefField` is now `cms.apps.media.fields`. This permits easier project-local overrides of the media app, because UnCMS's `Page` and helper models no longer import from `cms.apps.media.models`.
* `cms.views.handler500` has been retired, as it does nothing more than Django's built-in 500 view.
* The old pages dashboard item has been retired. It has a new one that works with no Javascript! ðŸŽ‰
* Probably fix the long-standing bug where the page tree gets randomly mangled.
* The `Video` model in the media app has been retired.
* `cms.context_processors`, which existed to put settings and the package version into templates, no longer exists. Having settings in the context by default makes it easy to make mistakes which expose secret settings. The package version was only ever there to advertise this software in the admin, but UnCMS no longer cares what your admin looks like.
* A pile of template overrides were removed.
