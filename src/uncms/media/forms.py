        `clean_file` checks that the given file is allowed to be uploaded
        based on the file extension. This is to prevent e.g. a .html file
        being uploaded; a less-privileged user might be able to cause a
        privilege escalation by uploading a .html file with malicious JS in
        it, then tricking a more-privileged user into visiting the URL, which
        could result in a privilege escalation.

        The default is to only allow images to be uploaded, unless the user
        has an explicit permission to upload dangerous files, or they are a
        superuser, in which case they can cause any amount of destruction like
        deleting everything on the site.

        It also checks nominal images to see if they do in fact match their
        declared contents. This comes from extensive experience of files being
        "converted" into some other format by changing the file extension.

        For most other formats, it doesn't matter if they upload with the
        wrong extension. With images, it means that exceptions will be raised
        when thumbnailing them. Note that this trusts the MIME type coming
        from the client; this is intended to prevent deliberate uploading of
        the wrong file type.
